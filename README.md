# Reputation-Based DAO Governance 🎭

Welcome to the **Reputation-Based DAO Governance** project! 🚀 This system enables decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to govern and make decisions through user reputation and voting. Members with sufficient reputation can create and vote on proposals, ensuring that only active participants shape the direction of the DAO. 

In this project, the contract is built using the **Clarity** smart contract language on the **Stacks** blockchain. The DAO is powered by reputation-based governance, meaning users can only participate in proposals if they hold a certain reputation score.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a smart contract system for DAO governance based on user reputation. It allows members to:

- Initialize user reputation
- Create new proposals
- Vote on proposals based on reputation
- Ensure that only users with sufficient reputation can participate in decision-making processes

The contract includes features like proposal creation, voting, and reputation tracking, which are all tied to a decentralized and transparent process.

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 🔒 **Reputation Management**
- Users can have a reputation score, and only those with sufficient reputation (default is `100`) can create or vote on proposals.
  
### 📝 **Proposal Creation**
- Any user with sufficient reputation can create a new proposal with a title and a specified block duration.

### ✔️ **Voting on Proposals**
- Users can vote on proposals based on their reputation score. Votes are weighted by the user's reputation.

### 🛑 **Voting Restrictions**
- Voting is restricted to active proposals and users with non-zero reputation.
- Proposals cannot be voted on after their expiration block.

## ⚙️ Smart Contract Functions

### `initialize-reputation`
Initializes the reputation of the user calling the contract. The default reputation is set to `100`.

### `create-proposal`
Allows a user to create a new proposal if they have a reputation greater than or equal to the minimum threshold.

## 🧪 Testing

We use **Vitest** for testing our DAO governance contract. Below are some key tests to ensure the integrity of the system:

### Key Tests:
- **Initialization**: Ensure user reputation is set correctly.
- **Proposal Creation**: Ensure only users with sufficient reputation can create proposals.
- **Voting**: Ensure only users with reputation can vote, and votes are correctly weighted.
- **Proposal Status**: Ensure voting is not allowed on inactive or expired proposals.
